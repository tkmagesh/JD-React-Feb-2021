    What is RIA?

    RIA built using HTML + CSS + JS 
        => SPA (Single Page Application)

        Responsibilities 
            Handling User Interaction (C)
            Generating Response (V)
            Managing State (M)


    Maintainability
        Easy to CHANGE
            1. Roles & Responsibilities
                SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

            2. 

        Fixing Bugs
        Adding new features
        Removing dead features
        Optimizing existing features

    class Employee {
        //public int id;
        private int _id;
        public void setId(value){

        }

    }

    Reactive (dumb) X Proactive (Knowledge)

    HTML vs JSX
    ===============
    HTML - "Only open tags" are allowed
    JSX - Every open tag must have the corresponding close tag

    HTML - 'for' attribute is allowed
    JSX - use 'htmlFor' instead

    HTML - 'class' attribute is allowed
    JSX - use 'className' instead


ES6 (EcmaScript 6, ES2015, ESNext)
    1. let
    2. const
    3. Array destructuring
    4. Rest operator (Array)
    5. Spread operator (Array)
    6. Object destructuring
    7. Rest operator (Object)
    8. Spread operator (Object)
    9. default arguments
    10. arrow functions
    11. template strings
    12. classes


In React
    Component = encapsulation of Presentation (JSX) + UI Behavior + UI State
              = Reusable
              = composable
              = SRP

    Application = composition of components
